# Linear least squares tensor fitting for Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)

Run ```s_tensor_fit.py``` on raw DWI acquisition to get the diffusion tensor and various diffusion parameters.

The diffusion tensor is simply the variable ```ten```. Diffusion parameters FA, MD, RD, V1, V2, V3, L1, L2, and L3 are saved as NIfTI files automatically.
